# PetScam-baiting
An Automated Response System for Disrupting Online Pet Scamming

## Project overview
The online pet scam is an increasingly sophisticated threat that can cause emotional and financial distress to victims. To aid the public in identifying and avoiding such pet scams, this project aims to develop an automated response system that wastes scammers' time and resources. Using web scraping, fake profiles, data analysis and visualization technologies, this system will leave contact information on various pet scam websites' contact pages, and engage scammers in prolonged conversations based on different scam-baiting templates. According to the statistical analysis of quantity, conversation, and time metrics as three types of quantitative metrics, we can reveal and optimize the most effective scam-baiting strategies. Ultimately, by reducing scammers' return on investment, the system can mitigate these harmful frauds and protect potential victims.

## Pet scam websites
On https://petscams.com/, which have listed known pet scam and delivery scam websites, is still in real-time updates.

## How to accomplish

  - leaving contact information on various pet scam websites' contact pages which are already listed on the https://petscams.com/.
2. Achieve a basic version first, which can be successfully run and tested the email conversations between you and the robot system.
3. Make some changes to other parts of the system in order to work the following three steps smoothly:
  - configure own directories and API keys.

  - waiting and fetching scam emails from pet scammers;
  - arranging for them to contact four different personalities(different scam-baiting templates) created by the gpt-3.5-turbo;

## Essential resources
