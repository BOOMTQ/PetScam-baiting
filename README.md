# PetScam-baiting
An Automated Response System for Disrupting Online Pet Scamming

## Project overview
The online pet scam is an increasingly sophisticated threat that can cause emotional and financial distress to victims. To aid the public in identifying and avoiding such pet scams, this project aims to develop an automated response system that wastes scammers' time and resources. Using web scraping, fake profiles, data analysis and visualization technologies, this system will leave contact information on various pet scam websites' contact pages, and engage scammers in prolonged conversations based on different scam-baiting templates. According to the statistical analysis of quantity, conversation, and time metrics as three types of quantitative metrics, we can reveal and optimize the most effective scam-baiting strategies. Ultimately, by reducing scammers' return on investment, the system can mitigate these harmful frauds and protect potential victims.
