# PetScam-baiting
An Automated Response System for Disrupting Online Pet Scamming

## Project overview
The online pet scam is an increasingly sophisticated threat that can cause emotional and financial distress to victims. To aid the public in identifying and avoiding such pet scams, this project aims to develop an automated response system that wastes scammers' time and resources. Using web scraping, fake profiles, data analysis and visualization technologies, this system will leave contact information on various pet scam websites' contact pages, and engage scammers in prolonged conversations based on different scam-baiting templates. According to the statistical analysis of quantity, conversation, and time metrics as three types of quantitative metrics, we can reveal and optimize the most effective scam-baiting strategies. Ultimately, by reducing scammers' return on investment, the system can mitigate these harmful frauds and protect potential victims.

## Pet scam websites
On https://petscams.com/, which have listed known pet scam and delivery scam websites, is still in real-time updates.

## Basic process of project
Project will involve creating a new process that acts as a sort of 'crawler', visiting pet scam sites and arranging for them to contact personalities created by the bot. It will probably has to make changes to other parts of the system to make this work smoothly, and for the experiments it'll want to disable the previous crawlers. To accomplish all this will need to get very familiar with the codebase, so getting a version of it running early on will be important.
该项目将涉及创建一个新进程，作为一种 "爬虫"，访问宠物诈骗网站，并安排它们与机器人创建的角色联系。可能需要对系统的其他部分进行修改，以使其顺利运行，而且在实验中，需要禁用以前的爬虫。要完成这些工作，需要非常熟悉代码库，因此尽早运行一个版本将非常重要。
